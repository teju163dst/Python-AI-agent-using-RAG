# Python-AI-agent-using-RAG
# Here I built a modified version of Python AI agent using RAG algorithm from youtube tutorial of Tech with Tim. I used Wikipedia website to collect population and demographic data of Seoul using Retrieval Augmented Generation. I fed world population dataset from kaggle to give context to the model so it can predict from the relevant data and not old training data. I used Llamaindex 0.9 version. To improvise this project I added korean and Japanese Companies operating in India pdf file alongside Seoul wikipedia data and questioned the agent based on these pdf data files.
